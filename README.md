## Description
Introducing the ultimate music memory game, where players match music symbols with their corresponding names. 

## How to play
Flip over cards to reveal the symbols and try to find the matching pair. If the cards match, they stay face up, but if they don't, they turn back over. The goal is to flip over the entire board, and the game keeps track of how many attempts it takes for you to complete it. Challenge yourself to beat your high score!
Match music symbols with terms, and try to get the lowest score. 

## Difficulty
With three levels of difficulty - easy, medium, and expert - the game offers a unique challenge for players of all skill levels. As the level increases, the board gets bigger and the difficulty of the music symbols increases, making it perfect for music enthusiasts of all levels.
